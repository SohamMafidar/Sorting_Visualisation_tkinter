There are multiple options to make a Sorting animation in python like using FunAnimation of Matplotlib.
But Tkinter is the easiest of the lot.

Here you can chose from Bubble Sort, Quick Sort or Merge Sort Algortihm. You can select the speed with which animation will be played.

 I will add more algorithms subsequently and will make a better GUI.

PS:- First click generate and then click start to see the animation.
